He is presented with a list of games to play with, he is able to choose and play any of the available games.
Barrett can choose to play single-player versus other computer players, or multi-player versus other people.
**[team story]**


- Barrett has two friends over and wants to see what games can be played by the three of them.
He enters the game library which displays all available card games. 
He selects a filter so only games that can be played by three players are displayed.
He can click on each game to see their descriptions. **[Amber’s story]**


- Barrett creates a room in the program, names it, and then Barrett selects the card game to play in the room,
and the program automatically sets the maximum and minimum number of people in the room based on the card game selected.
Barrett can access a list of players in the room or read the rules of selected card games. **[Jiakun’s story]**


- For single-player, Barrett can select the number of computer players, which will play the game relatively optimally with some variance.
For multiplayer, Barrett will be given a way to share his game room with others who can connect, such as searching by the roomID. **[Artour’s story]**


- For single-player, Barrett can choose the difficulty level of the game.
The computer player(s) can adjust based on the difficulty level chosen. For multi-player, computer players can automatically
join an online room if the number of people in the room doesn’t reach the minimum people required to play the game.
