5. Open `Main.main()` under `src`->`main`->`java`->`app`->`Main.java`.
6. Import any packages popping up on the right corners.
7. You can now run `Main.main()` by clicking on the green triangle ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5632a8a1-a170-425b-b881-ea45d24e36ef).

### Common problems encountered when trying to run `Main.main()`:
#### You need to use `maven` to load the project:
- - `Lucky-Aces`->`pom.xml` right click-> `Add as Maven Project` or `Maven`->`Reload project`
#### You need to mark the `java` folder as the Sources root:
- - `src`->`main`->`java` right click->`Mark Directory as`->`Sources Root`
  - After you have successfully marked `java` as the Sources root, the folder icon will turn blue like this.
